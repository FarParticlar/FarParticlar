# Info
This is a copy of my readme.md from my other account. And you'll probably have one question:
- you fucking thief! 
- That's not true, I lost access to my past github account. This is where I will continue to post my repositories and also clone those that were left in my previous account.
- If you know how to delete a past account then post in issues in any of my repositories, I'll answer right away!
